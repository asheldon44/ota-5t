-Testbenches for 5T OTA in IHP 130nm open-source PDK for use in Xschem/Ngspice. Currently covers DC, AC, stability, and noise simulations. 

-Will be expanded to cover all relevant parameters.

-DO NOT copy the design, it is not a good circuit, this was created to figure out the different simulations in XSchem/NGSpice.
